# S.S.Chern-Complex Manifolds
LaTeX typesetting of S.S. Chern's *Complex Manifolds* (Work in progress). 

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a complete and high-quality LaTeX typeset version of S.S. Chern's classic text, *Complex Manifolds*.

## Current Status & Note
The work is currently **unfinished**. The initial transcription leveraged AI tools for efficiency, and as a result, **the existing files contain a substantial number of bugs, inaccuracies, and incomplete sections.** Manual proofreading and correction are urgently needed.
